    -- one with an error, one with a warning, and one with an Unknown

    -- Add at least 3 more tests for MessageType parsing in isolation.

    -- Add tests for timestamp parsing.  Think in particular about
    -- what the function does if the input doesn't start with a digit,
    -- or has some spaces followed by digits.

    -- How many tests do you think is enough?  Write at least 3
    -- sentences explaining your decision.

    -- Write at least 5 tests for 'insert', with sufficiently
    -- different inputs to test most of the cases.  Look at your code
    -- for 'insert', and any bugs you ran into while writing it.

    -- Next week we'll have the computer write more tests, to help us
    -- be more confident that we've tested all the tricky bits and
    -- edge cases.  There are also tools to make sure that our tests
    -- actually run every line of our code (called "coverage"), but we
    -- won't learn those this year.

    -- Write tests for 'inOrder'.  Remember that the input tree is
    -- meant to already be sorted, so it's fine to only test such
    -- inputs.  You may want to reuse MessageTrees from the tests on
    -- 'insert' above.  You may even want to move them elsewhere in
    -- the file and give them names, to more easiely reuse them.
